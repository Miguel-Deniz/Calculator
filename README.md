<h2>Setup</h2>
To install and configure the program you will need an IDE, such as Visual Studio 2013, and a copy of the source code.
The code does not use any special libraries, and should be easily configured in any environment.  Download the two files "std_lib_facilities.h" written by Bjanre Stroustrup and "main.cpp". Put these two files into your IDE and hit run.
